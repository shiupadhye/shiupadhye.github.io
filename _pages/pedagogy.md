<p> <small> <strong> P.S., </strong>  Like many folks who eventually find themselves in the cognitive sciences, I started with more of a scrappy, working definition for a career path (this was well before AI or LLMs had really permeated public consciousness, which I think has given <em> cognitive science </em> and <em> computational linguistics <\em> just a little more name recognition). It took a whole lot of trial and error to stumble upon this niche, and I'm happy to pass on whatever I've learned. Please reach out if you believe I can help out in any way! </small> </p>
