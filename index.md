*(My last name is pronounced /upadʰje/ but /upaðje/ or oo-pa-the-ye is a close approximation)*

I'm a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Language Science at the University of California - Irvine, where I'm advised [Dr. Richard Futrell](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/) and affiliated with the [Language Processing Group](https://langprocgroup.github.io/) and the [meaning lab](https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~gscontra//meaning/). Before this, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Cognitive Science with a concentation in Machine Learning and Neural Computation with minor in Math from University of California - San Diego.*

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding the computational and cognitive principles underlying language use in humans and (large) language models (LLMs). Presently, I'm fascinated by several questions at the heart of language production — a process that is often pardoxically described as being both *easy* and *effortful*. Much of my ongoing work uses computational cognitive modeling, corpus analysis, behavioral experiments, and NLP methods to characterize how information processing constraints and communicative pressures shape speaker choices in online production.

Conversely, I'm also interesting in using insights from cognitive science and psycholinguistic theory to decode (pun intended) language model behavior. My undergrad research focused on investigating how lexico-semantic and discourse structure knowledge shapes the choice of referring expressions in LMs. Understanding the representational and mechanistic properties of LMs is still an active research interest of mine, and some of my ongoing projects in this area use psycholinguistically motivated approaches to explore sentence planning, pragmatic reasoning, and mutual intelligibility in language models.

\* Yes, there is such a thing as too much Southern California sunshine. It can be a real affliction for those of who prefer unreasonably extreme weather.
