## About Me

( My last name is pronounced  */'upadʰje/* with the voiced aspirated dental stop /dʰ/, but I'll respond to */'upaðje/* or *oo - pa - the - ye* ) 

I'm a PhD candidate studying Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Psychology (aka Language Science) at the University of California, Irvine, where I'm advised by [Dr. Richard Futrell](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/). Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding the representations and mechanisms underlying language use in humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Currently, I'm fascinated by a paradox at the heart of how we produce language — a process that looks tremendously complex on paper (decisions, decisions, every step of the way), yet somehow *feels* easy enough that we engage in it so frequently. Much of my ongoing work combines computational cognitive modeling, corpus analysis, and behavioral methods in service of this question — in particular, I study how cognitive resource constraints and performance demands shape choices in language production. 

Before coming to UC Irvine, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, and Neural Computation with a minor in Math at UC San Diego. While at UCSD, I worked on investigating lexico-semantic, pragmatic, and discourse structure knowledge in LLMs. 

Outside of all this, I enjoy books, puzzles and board games of all sorts, (attempts at) gardening, and skating on (not so) thin ice! ⛸️
