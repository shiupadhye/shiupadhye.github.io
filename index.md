## About Me

( My last name is pronounced  */'upadʰje/* with a voiced aspirated dental stop /dʰ/, but */'upaðje/* or *oo - pa - the - ye* is fine too) 

I'm a PhD candidate in Language Science at the University of California, Irvine, where I'm advised by [Dr. Richard Futrell](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/). Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding the representations and mechanisms underlying language use in humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Currently, I'm fascinated by a paradox at the heart of how we produce language — a process that *seems* deceptively easy, but is actually tremendously complex (decisions, decisions, every step of the way). In particular, much of my ongoing work — which draws on computational cognitive modeling, corpus analysis, and behavioral methods — focuses on how cognitive resource constraints and performance demands shape production choices. 

Before coming to UC Irvine, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, and Neural Computation with a minor in Math at UC San Diego. While at UCSD, I worked on investigating lexico-semantic, pragmatic, and discourse structure knowledge in LLMs. Understanding representations and mechanistic processing in LLMs is still very much a research interest of mine, and some of my current projects explore pragmatic reasoning and mutual intelligibility in LLMs. 

Outside of all this, I enjoy books, puzzles, chess, board games, and skating on (not so) thin ice! ⛸️
