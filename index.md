## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the [Language Processing Group](https://langprocgroup.github.io/) at the University of California, Irvine, where I'm advised by [Dr. Richard Futrell](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/). Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding the representations and mechanisms underlying language use in humans and LLMs. 

Currently, I find myself fascinated by a paradox at the heart of language production — a process that looks tremendously complex on paper (decisions, decisions, every step of the way), yet somehow *feels* easy enough.  **Much of my recent work combines computational cognitive modeling, corpus analysis, and behavioral methods to examine how cognitive constraints and performance demands shape production choices in speech and typing. 

Before coming to UC Irvine, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, and Neural Computation with a minor in Math at UC San Diego. While at UCSD, I worked on investigating  lexico-semantic, pragmatic, and discourse structure knowledge in LLMs. 

Outside of all this, I enjoy books, board games of all sorts, (attempts at) gardening, and skating on (not so) thin ice! ⛸️
